# crafing-py-chat
Minecraft stores old chat logs in Gzip .log files. To escape having to manually unzip these files with another program, I created a Python script to do it for me.
By extending this idea, I hope to create a functional program that is easy to use anytime I feel like looking through my old Minecraft chat logs.

This program can also be used to look at contents of any text file zipped by gzip I assume.
