# crafing-py-chat
Minecraft stores old chat logs in Gzip .log files. To escape having to manually unzip these files with another program, I created a Python script to do it for me.
By extending this idea, I hope to create a functional program that is easy to use anytime I feel like looking through my old Minecraft chat logs.

This program is a work in progress as I believe I need to fix issues that could arise such as too much memory being used and display in sections still not working
100%.

# Features
- Displaying all the contents of a log file in the console
- Displaying file by pages
- Directory searching options
- File Search options
- Writing the contents to a text
